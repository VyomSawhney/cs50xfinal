#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/0YKQ1KMGX3M
#### Description: Hello, this is my final project for CS50x where I have created a converter in the programming language C to convert Distances, Temps, and Liquids. Hope you enjoy! This course has been amazing and has opened many doorways that were unknown to me before I found this course. This course went in so much detail and the community around the course was amazing. If I ever needed help on this final I could just post a question. This final project showed that I had learned something that I was not capable of doing prior. This course took me some time but I would say it was well over worth it. I had some python knowlage before but never knew as much as I do now. What I did before look easy as a cake now. My converter is written in C and uses if statements and equations to calculate the outcome. This course has also opened me to many helpful resources such as github which has come into use as I connect with more friends and do more programming projects to make a change in the world. CS50x is the launch pad for beginners.
