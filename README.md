# Converter Written In C
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/0YKQ1KMGX3M
#### Description:
Hello, this is my final project for CS50x where I have created a converter in the programming language C to convert Distances, Temps, and Liquids. I had orignially decided to try LOVE lua but I relized that game development is just not something that intrests me too much. I was originally deciding to make this converter with only 3 things and 1 way (Ex. Feet to inches, Gallons to Cups, F to C) Then I thought to myself that this is my FINAL the finale of my course I should not just be lazy. I then decided to make it 8 options with 2 ways, giving it a total of 16 diffrent conversions. This was mostly accomplished using if statements and user input to narrow down which selection was needed.


This course has been amazing and has opened many doorways that were unknown to me before I found this course. This course went in so much detail and the community around the course was amazing. If I ever needed help on this final I could just post a question. This final project showed that I had learned something that I was not capable of doing prior. This course took me some time but I would say it was well over worth it. I had some python knowlage before but never knew as much as I do now. What I did before look easy as a cake now This course has also opened me to many helpful resources such as github which has come into use as I connect with more friends and do more programming projects to make a change in the world. CS50x is the launch pad for beginners.
